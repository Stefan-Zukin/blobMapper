# blobMapper
BlobMapper is a tool which aids in building models from CryoEM or X-ray electron density maps. Often is is difficult to identify which protein chains are responsible for a given area of electron density. The best ways to identify these chains are by looking for patterns of noticeable large or small residues and trying to see which protein sequence could match that pattern. BlobMapper is a tool to help structural biologists turn these 'blobs' into residues.
